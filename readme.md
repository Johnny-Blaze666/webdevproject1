# Johnny Rivera Styled Resume

Although there are atributes about other archetype's such as the Innocent and Sage that I can relate to, for my resume design I decided that the Explorer archetype aligned most with my personality. I'm not an artist or creative person, but where I can relate most is in being analytical and independent. The Exlporer archetype has a strong situational awareness, at times works well with others, but prefers work alone. 

For the font I chose Merienda, because it is elegant, easy to read and narrow typeface that allows for more words to fit on a line. I varied the size of the headings, body and contact information.

The color scheme is monochromatic palette of dark gray (`#333`) and a muted shade of brown (`#7B6F63`), with blue lines (`#0077cc`)breaking each section. These colors are representative of the Exlporers connection with nature.

The background image is a personal picture of mine overseeing the ocean at sunset, taken that lighthouse in Rincon, Puerto Rico. This is demonstrative of the adventurous, patient spirit of the Explorer that can at times isolated and alone.

Through my design I attempted to depict the good nature, thoughtfulness and at times the isolation that embodies the Explorer.
