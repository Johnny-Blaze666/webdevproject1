# Johnny Rivera Styled Resume

Although there are atributes about other archetype's such as the Innocent and Sage that I can relate to, for my resume design I decided that the Explorer archetype aligned most with my personality. I'm not an artist or creative person, but where I can relate most is in being analytical and independent. The Exlporer archetype has a strong situational awareness, at times works well with others, but prefers work alone. 

For the font I chose Merienda, because it is elegant, easy to read and narrow typeface that allows for more words to fit on a line. I varied the size of the headings, body and contact information.

The color scheme is monochromatic palette of dark gray ('#F5512A'), and a ligh brown (`#FBFFFF`), with blue lines (`#0077cc`)breaking each section. These colors are representative of the Exlporers connection with nature.

The background image was downloaded from Unsplash, of a lighthouse. This is demonstrative of the adventurous, patient spirit of the Explorer that can at times isolated and alone.

Through my design I attempted to depict the good nature, thoughtfulness and at times the isolation that embodies the Explorer.
